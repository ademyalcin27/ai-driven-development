* More tests documentation found in [README.md](mdc:tests/README.md).(tests/README.md)

## Unit Tests
* Unit tests are written with Vitest
* Are written alongside the code they are testing (in the same directory)

## E2E Tests
* E2E tests are written with Playwright
* E2E tests are written in the tests/e2e/ directory
