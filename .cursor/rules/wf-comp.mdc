* Create simple props down, events up components that don't interact with any API endpoints.
* Optimize them as if their consuming components WILL be getting data from API endpoints
* Add a page in the `app/pages/playground` directory with hardcoded dummy data passed in to the props and reacting to events.
* You can make curl requests and use the playwright mcp to check the results of the demo page
* ALWAYS read the [components.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/components.mdc)
